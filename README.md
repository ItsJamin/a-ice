## Machine Learning Models

### aCorn

to recognize simple, hand-drawn shapes such as:
- cross
- circle
- line
- rectangle
- triangle

A tool to draw images for labels and add them to datasets.

Standards for pictures:
- 256x256

### Model Prediction Tool

With this tool you can draw images, and loaded model (image classifier model) guesses what it should be.

## Data

Current datasets:

### simple shapes (256x256)

Image Classifier

Black and white images of hand-drawn shapes:
- circle
- line
- cross
- triangle
- rectangle
